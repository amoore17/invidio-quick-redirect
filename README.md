## Summary
Redirect youtube.com to invidious.xyz without making a single connection to YouTube.
After the main invidio.us instance was taken down, I have revised this extension to
point to invidious.xyz instead. If you would like to change to another instance,
simply replace the "invidious.xyz" string with the domain of the instance you would
like to use instead.
